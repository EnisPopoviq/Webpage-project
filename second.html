    <h1 class="story-title py-5">How To Slow Down In Life</h1>
    <p class="story-subtitle">A Real-Life Story by Tammy Strobel</p>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>Before I began to simplify my life, I was on the go constantly. I didn’t feel like I had enough time to rest, pursue hobbies, or to hang out with friends. I never thought about how to slow down in life. My days were too busy, and my pace wasn’t sustainable.</p>

      <p>Letting go of my “go, go, go” mindset took time. I began my adventures in slow living by changing my habits and setting boundaries. I did this very slowly because I wanted my habit changes and new boundaries to stick. My strategy worked!</p>
      
      <p>Slowing down the pace of my life has been invaluable. I’ve given myself the gift of time. I’m able to focus on creative projects, spend time with friends, rest, do nothing, and more. I’m incredibly grateful for that.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What does it mean to “slow down”?</strong></p>
      
      <p>For me, slowing down is a combination of practicing mindfulness, getting enough rest, and prioritizing what matters in my life. When I find myself rushing from task to task, email to email, or from project to project, I return to Pico Iyer’s words.</p>
      
      <p>Iyer is one of my favorite authors because one facet of his work is about slowing down.</p>
      
      <p>In Iyer’s 2014 TED Talk – <span class="highlight">The Art of Stillness</span> – he said,</p>
      
      <p class="quote">“…in an age of acceleration, nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction, nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement, nothing is so urgent as sitting still.”</p>
